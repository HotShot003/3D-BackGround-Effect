# 3D Background Effect with Parallax Scrolling using Pygame

This project demonstrates a 3D background effect with parallax scrolling implemented using Python and Pygame.

The background consists of multiple layers that move at different speeds to simulate depth and create a dynamic visual effect.

## Overview

In this project, we use Pygame to create a 3D-like background effect using parallax scrolling.
Parallax scrolling involves moving background layers at different speeds relative to the foreground, giving the illusion of depth. 
This effect is commonly used in 2D and 3D games to enhance the visual experience.

## About Parallax :

Parallax scrolling is a technique used in 2D and 3D graphics to create an illusion of depth by moving background layers at different speeds relative to the foreground. 

This effect mimics the way objects appear to move differently based on their distance from the viewer. 

Parallax scrolling is widely used in video games, websites, and multimedia applications to add visual interest and enhance immersion.

## Features

Multiple background layers moving at different speeds.

Simulated depth perception using parallax scrolling.

Player-controlled movement to demonstrate the effect.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys (a or d) to move the player and observe the parallax effect.

Note : key_a -move left and key_d -move right
