# 3D Background Effect with Parallax Scrolling using Pygame

This project demonstrates a 3D background effect with parallax scrolling implemented using Python and Pygame.
The background consists of multiple layers that move at different speeds to simulate depth and create a dynamic visual effect.

# Overview

In this project, we use Pygame to create a 3D-like background effect using parallax scrolling.
Parallax scrolling involves moving background layers at different speeds relative to the foreground, giving the illusion of depth. 
This effect is commonly used in 2D and 3D games to enhance the visual experience.

# Features

Multiple background layers moving at different speeds.

Simulated depth perception using parallax scrolling.

Player-controlled movement to demonstrate the effect.

# Controls

Use the arrow keys (a or d) to move the player and observe the parallax effect.

Note : key_a -move left and key_d -move right

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to Pygame for providing the graphics and input handling capabilities.

Inspiration for the parallax scrolling effect from GameDev.net.
